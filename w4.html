    <h3>Quotes from Coders</h3>
    
    <ul>

      <li>"The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed
      from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from
      air, creating by exertion of the imagination." &mdash; Fred Brooks </li>

      <li>"A programmer is ideally an essayist who works
      with traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as
      mathematical concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm
      works and to convince a reader that the results will be
      correct." &mdash;  Donald Knuth</li>

      <li>"A human must turn information into intelligence or
      knowledge. We've tended to forget that no computer will ever ask
      a new question." &mdash; Grace Hopper </li>

    </ul>
