	<p> In <i>Speaking Code</i> Franco Berardi writes,
	  "Prescriptions, prophesies, injunctions are ways of
	  inscribing the future in language and &mdash;most
	  importantly&mdash;are ways of producing the future by means
	  of language." More generally, codes inscribe the relations
	  between semiotic elements and thereby determine how the
	  future will unfold.  For example, a military code of conduct
	  will determine ethical actions a soldier might take.  Why do
	  codes act in this way?  How might it be possible for them
	  behave differently? What other types of codes are there?

	<p>Also, find a few related images, links or videos online and write
	  down their URLs (i.e., links) and bring these to the
	  first coding workshop.
