	<p> In <i>Speaking Code</i> Franco Berardi writes,
	  "Prescriptions, prophesies, injunctions are ways of
	  inscribing the future in language and &mdash;most
	  importantly&mdash;are ways of producing the future by means
	  of language." More generally, codes inscribe the relations
	  between semiotic elements and thereby determine how the
	  future will unfold.  For example, a military code of conduct
	  will determine ethical actions a soldier might take.  Why do
	  codes act in this way?  How might it be possible for them
	  behave differently? What other types of codes are there?

	<p>In 1971's <i>Teaching as Subversive Activity</i>, Postman
	  and Weingartner write "Because the process of knowing is
	  inseparable from "languaging," in the new education,
	  language (i.e., all forms of symbolic codification) is
	  regarded as the mediator of all human perception and is used
	  as a unifying and continuing focus of all student inquiry."
	  What happens when we swap <i>languaging</i>
	  with <i>coding</i>; and <i>language</i> with <i>code</i>?
	  How would the meaning of this statement change? What would
	  the word <i>code</i> come to mean?

	<p>After responding, find a few images, links or videos online
	  and write down their URLs (i.e., links) that relate to your
	  thoughts and bring these and the text of your freewrite to the first coding workshop.
