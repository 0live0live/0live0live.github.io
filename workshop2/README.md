Code as Language; Code and Language
===================================

Readings and computational materials are organized by theme, though many different combinations beyond those suggested here are possible.

Themes
------

-   **Language as a code**

    Language seems to be one means to encode thought; the same can be said for computer programs. However, explaining language and its relation to codes and coding remains elusive. Can we view coding as translation from thought to language? Must you understand to translate?

    Language and coding both provide tools for thought and exploration.

    Can you translate "slithy toves" to French?  
    *[Goedel, Escher, Bach]()*. Hofstadter. pp. 372 -- 383.

-   **Code acts**

    Both language and code react to and act on their context. However, do they have the same status as tools of thought?

    Sentences, whether in code or language, often have truth values. However, language and code are more often used to do something --- to act.

-   **Codes for creativity**

    How do codes help us create? How is language generated by machine different from the creative process? Can it generate new ideas in the reader?

    These algorithms generate poetry and prose via algorithms and input data.

    This one is too much and too long. We should ind a short reading on creativity with coding.
