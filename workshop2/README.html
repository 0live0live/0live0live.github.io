      <h1>Code as Language; Code and Language</h1>

      <p>Readings and computational materials are organized by
      theme, though many different combinations beyond those suggested
      here are possible.</p>
      
      <h2>Themes</h2>

      <ul>

	<li><b>Language as a code</b>

	<p>Language seems to be one means to encode thought; the
	same can be said for computer programs.  However, explaining
	language and its relation to codes and coding remains elusive.
	Can we view coding as translation from thought to
	language? Must you understand to translate?</P>

	    </dt>
	    <dt>Language and coding both provide tools for thought and exploration.

            Reason</b>. Weizenbaum. Pg. 107 -- 110. W.H. Freeman and

	    </dt>
	</dl>

	</li>
	
	<li> <b>Code acts</b>

	<p>Both language and code react to and act on
	their context.  However, do they have the same status as 
	tools of thought?</p>

	    <dt>Sentences, whether in code or language, often have
	    truth values.  However, language and code are more often
	    used to do something --- to act.

	</li>
	    
	<li> <b>Codes for creativity</b>

	<p>How do codes help us create?
	How is language generated by machine different from the creative
	process? Can it generate new ideas in the reader?</P>
