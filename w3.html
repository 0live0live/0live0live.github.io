    <h1>Is Code Language?</h1>

    <h3>Quotes from Coders</h3>
    
    <ul>
      
      <li>"The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed
      from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from
      air, creating by exertion of the imagination." &mdash;  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks">Fred Brooks</a> </li>
      
      <li>"A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with
      traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical
      concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to
      convince a reader that the results will be correct." &mdash;  <a href
      ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald
      Knuth</a></li>

      <li>"A human must turn information into intelligence or
      knowledge. We've tended to forget that no computer will ever ask
      a new question." &mdash; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a></li>
