    <h3>Quotes from Coders</h3>

    <blockquote>
        "<span class = "redacted">The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed
        from pure </span> thought-stuff<span class = "redacted">. He </span>builds <span class = "redacted">his castles in the air, from
        air, creating</span> by exertion<span class = "redacted">of the imagination</span>."<b>&mdash;  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks">Fred Brooks</a></b>
    </blockquote>

          
    <blockquote>"A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with
      traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical
      concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to
      convince a reader that the results will be correct." <i>&mdash; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a></i></blockquote>

    <blockquote>"A human must turn information into intelligence or
      knowledge. We've tended to forget that no computer will ever ask
      a new question." <b>&mdash; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a></b></blockquote>
