## Quotes 

"You think you know when you learn, are more sure when you can write,
even more when you can teach, but certain when you can program." Alan
Perlis.

"Science is knowledge which we understand so well that we can teach it
to a computer; and if we don't fully understand something, it is an art
to deal with it." Donald Knuth. *Computer Programming as an Art*.

"The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure
thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by
exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so
easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand
conceptual structures. Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's
words, is real in  the sense that it moves and works, producing visible
outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws
pictures, produces sounds, moves arms. The magic of myth and legend has
come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard,
and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor
could be." [Fred
Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks). 
[*The Mythical Man Month*](https://archive.org/stream/mythicalmanmonth00fred/mythicalmanmonth00fred_djvu.txt%2520https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/108/snelesen/references/brooks.html).
[The Joys and Woes of the Craft.](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/references/brooksJoysAndWoes.html)

"...we want to establish the idea that a computer language is not just a
way of getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is a
novel formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus,
programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for
machines to execute." Abelson and Sussman. [**Structures and
Interpretations of Computer Programs**](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/front/node3.html).

"the computer is being used to program the child. In my vision, the
child programs the computer and in doing so, both acquires a sense of
mastery over a piece of the most modern and powerful technology and
establishes an intimate contact with some of the deepest ideas from
science, from mathematics, and from the art of intellectual model
building". Papert. **Mindstorms**.

"For one thing, the entry cost will be very low, in the same sense that
the entry cost for writing is low today. As a result, millions of people
will write non-trivial programs, and hundreds of thousands will try to
sell them. Of course, the market will be much larger and very much more
diverse than it is now, just as paper is more widespread and is used in
many more ways than are adding machines. Almost everyone who uses a
pencil will use a computer, and although most people will not do any
serious programming, almost everyone will be a potential customer for
serious programs of some kind Furthermore, such a mass market will
require mass distribution. Analogues of bookstores, newsstands and
magazine subscriptions seem plausible, as well as the kind of mail-order
and home improvement marketing patterns we have now. Butler Lampson
(1972). [Programmers as
Authors](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/blampson/10-SPEGuestEditorial/WebPage.html).
