    <h3>Quotes from Coders</h3>
    <blockquote>"The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed
      from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from
      air, creating by exertion of the imagination." <b> &mdash; Fred Brooks</b></blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>"A human must turn information into intelligence or
	knowledge. We've tended to forget that no computer will ever ask
	a new question." <b>&mdash; Grace Hopper</b></blockquote>
    

    <h3>Quotes from Linguists</h3>

    <blockquote>"Language disguises thought."
      <b> &mdash;Ludwig Wittgenstein</b>
    </blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>"Language is a process of free creation; its laws and
    principles are fixed, but the manner in which the principles of
    generation are used is free and infinitely varied. Even the
    interpretation and use of words involves a process of free
    creation."
      <b> &mdash;Noam Chomsky</b>
    </blockquote>
    
    
    <blockquote>"Journalists say that when a dog bites a man, that is
    not new, but when a man bites a dog that is news.  This is the
    essence of the langauge instinct: language conveys news."
      <b> &mdash;Steven Pinker</b>
    </blockquote>
