    <h3>DECODING CODE: What do we mean by code?</h3>

    <h3>Quotes from Coders</h3>
    
      <blockquote>"The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed
	from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from
	air, creating by exertion of the imagination."<b>&mdash;  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks">Fred Brooks</a></b></blockquote>
      
      <blockquote>"A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with
	traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical
	concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to
	convince a reader that the results will be correct." <b>&mdash;
	  <a href =  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a></b></blockquote>
      
      <blockquote>"A human must turn information into intelligence or
	knowledge. We've tended to forget that no computer will ever ask
	a new question." <b>&mdash;
	  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a></b></blockquote>

      <blockquote>"The <a href =
      "https://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html">Analytical Engine</a>
      has no pretensions whatever to <i>originate</i> anything. It can
      do whatever we <i>know how to order it</i> to perform. It
      can <i>follow</i> analysis; but it has no power of
      <i>anticipating</i> any analytical relations or truths. Its province is
      to assist us to making <i>available</i> what we are already acquainted
      with." <b>&mdash;
	  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a></b></blockquote>
