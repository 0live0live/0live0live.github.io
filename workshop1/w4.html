    <h3>Quotes from Coders</h3>
    
      <blockquote><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks"><img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Fred_Brooks.jpg" alt = "Fred Brooks" class = "headshot"></a>"The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed
	from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from
	air, creating by exertion of the imagination." </blockquote>
      
      <blockquote><a href =  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth"><img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/KnuthAtOpenContentAlliance.jpg" alt = "Donald Knuth" class = "headshot"></a>"A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with
	traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical
	concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to
	convince a reader that the results will be correct." </blockquote>
      
      <blockquote><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper"><img src =
	"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Commodore_Grace_M._Hopper%2C_USN_%28covered%29.jpg"
	alt = "Grace Hopper" class = "headshot"></a>"A human must turn information into intelligence or
	knowledge. We've tended to forget that no computer will ever
	ask a new question." </blockquote>

      <blockquote><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace"><img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Ada_Lovelace_portrait.jpg" alt = "Ada Lovelace" class = "headshot"></a> "The <a href =
      "https://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html">Analytical Engine</a>
      has no pretensions whatever to <i>originate</i> anything. It can
      do whatever we <i>know how to order it</i> to perform. It
      can <i>follow</i> analysis; but it has no power of
      <i>anticipating</i> any analytical relations or truths. Its province is
      to assist us to making <i>available</i> what we are already acquainted
      with."  </blockquote> 

      <h3>The Web is our Shared Memory</h3>

    </p><blockquote>
      "Presumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. His excursions may be more enjoyable if he can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if they prove important."
